# PersonaForge Framework: Vision

## Product Name

**PersonaForge**

## Vision

To provide a flexible, scalable, and highly-testable framework for building multi-channel, multi-persona conversational applications.

## Core Idea

The framework's philosophy is to treat every participant in a conversation (be it a human or a bot) as a first-class **`Persona`**. Every communication platform (Telegram, WhatsApp, a CRM system) is treated as a pluggable **`Application`**.

PersonaForge provides the core building blocks (such as the `Chat` and `BotPersona` contexts) and a clear architectural pattern for developers to compose these blocks into a complete, robust solution.
