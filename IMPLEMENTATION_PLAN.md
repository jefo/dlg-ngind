# Lead Qualification Bot Implementation Plan

## Project Goal
Implement a lead qualification bot using existing `@packages/bot-persona` FSM engine for deployment on kwork.

## 1. Requirements Analysis
- Review LEAD_QUALIFICATION_BOT.md specification
- Review LEAD_QUALIFICATION_CONVERSATION_DESIGN.md for detailed flow
- Identify required components within existing system
- Confirm FSM engine capabilities meet requirements
- Map conversation design to technical implementation

## 2. Design Phase
- Define bot persona using Model-As-A-Code approach
- Map conversation flow to FSM states and transitions based on conversation design
- Design view components for each state with appropriate questions
- Plan data collection and storage approach with qualification scoring
- Design error handling and fallback mechanisms

## 3. Implementation
- Create bot definition in `@packages/bot-persona/src/design`
- Implement FSM definition with required states based on conversation design
- Create view definitions for user interactions with proper questions and options
- Set up form definitions for data collection with validation
- Implement lead qualification scoring logic
- Configure lead data storage (using existing adapters)

## 4. Integration
- Integrate with `@chat` for messaging platform support
- Configure lead data export/capture mechanism with scoring
- Set up analytics tracking for conversion rates
- Implement consultation booking integration (Calendly or similar)
- Test end-to-end flow

## 5. Testing
- Unit tests for bot persona definition
- Integration tests with chat system
- User acceptance testing with conversation design validation
- Performance testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

## 6. Deployment
- Deploy to production environment
- Configure kwork link integration
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Prepare sales team for lead follow-up with qualification scoring
- Create documentation for lead handling process

## 7. Timeline
- Week 1: Design and implementation
- Week 2: Integration, testing, and deployment

## 8. Success Criteria
- Bot successfully guides users through qualification flow based on conversation design
- Lead data properly captured and stored with qualification scoring
- Consultation CTA effectively presented
- Integration with kwork functioning correctly
- Completion rate > 80%
- Average completion time < 2 minutes

## 9. What NOT to Implement (YAGNI)
- New conversation engines
- NLU capabilities  
- Knowledge base systems
- Complex reusable modules
- Advanced analytics beyond basic tracking
- Multi-platform support beyond existing `@chat` capabilities

## 10. Risk Mitigation
- Use existing, proven components
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Implement comprehensive testing based on conversation design
- Prepare rollback plan
- Validate conversation flow with real users before full deployment
