# Bot Categories and Modules (For Future Reference)

This is a minimal reference for bot categories and reusable modules we may want to implement in the future.

## Bot Categories
1. **Linear Flow Bots** - Simple sequential interactions (onboarding, surveys, lead qualification)
2. **FAQ/Knowledge Base Bots** - Information retrieval (customer support)
3. **Intent-Driven Bots** - Natural language processing (AI assistants)
4. **Process Automation Bots** - Business rule execution (workflow automation)
5. **Complex Hybrid Bots** - Multi-pattern interactions (enterprise assistants)

## Reusable Modules
1. Booking/Appointment Management
2. Product/Service Catalog Search
3. Order Management and Processing
4. User Onboarding and Information Collection
5. FAQ and Knowledge Base Query
6. Notification and Reminder System
7. Loyalty and Rewards Management
8. Feedback Collection and Review Management
9. Content Delivery and Distribution
10. Lead Generation and Qualification
11. Multi-Channel Communication
12. Assessment and Evaluation

## Current Status
- Linear Flow Bots: SUPPORTED (FSM engine)
- All others: FUTURE WORK

## Engine Types Needed
- FSM Engine: IMPLEMENTED
- Search Engine: FUTURE
- NLU Engine: FUTURE
- Rule Engine: FUTURE
- Hybrid Engine: FUTURE

This reference is for future planning, not immediate implementation.
